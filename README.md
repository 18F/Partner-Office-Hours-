# Partners-Network

This is a pilot for forward thinking civic servants that 18F has previously worked with. Its an opportunity to connect with fellow agile/human-centered design thinkers across federal agencies, share best practices, and grow our skills together with people from 18F and former 18F partners. 

The goal of this meeting will be to kickoff this Partners Network, and brainstorm the most valuable topics to address as a group as each agency works to build its modern agile/hcd practices.
