# Partners-Network

18F Partners Network is a monthly office hours for forward thinking civic servants that 18F has previously worked with to connect with fellow agile/human-centered design thinkers across federal agencies, to learn and share best practices, and grow skills together with members of 18F. 

### Join us!
If you are a federal employee and have previously collaborated on a project with 18F and interested in learning more please email: 18Fpartners@gsa.gov 

# Office Hours
The Partners Network meets monthly for an hour to discuss relevent topics and share best practices.

### Collaboration tools
Remote collaboration tools that people across agencies can use vary but are important to help us connect
- we use online whiteboarding tools to share thoughts, synthesize info and dot-vote 
- we use video chat tools to better connect remotely

We are testing github for documenting our meetings and getting feedback
- sign up for a [free github account](https://github.com/join) 

Visit this repository's wiki page for how to use github issues collaborate and share feedback.
